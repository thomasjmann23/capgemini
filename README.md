## Week 0-1 Recap

### Week 0: Project Initiation
- **Stakeholder alignment** and project scope definition
- **Literature review** of packaging optimization in fashion retail
- **Initial data assessment** and infrastructure setup

### Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Quality Assessment

#### Dataset Overview Discovered:
| Dataset | Records | Key Finding |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **DensityReports** | 500,000 | Central dataset with packaging quality labels; significant data quality issues |
| **ProductAttributes** | ~10,000 | Complete product catalog with technical specifications |
| **SupplierScorecard** | 18 months | Monthly supplier performance metrics with clear performance patterns |
| **HistoricalIncidents** | ~18,000 | Real-world packaging failure documentation |

#### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Supplier Name Inconsistencies**: 47 variations of 5 actual suppliers
   - Examples: "SupplierA" vs "Supp_A" vs "SplA" vs "SUPPLIER_A"
   
2. **Categorical Data Pollution**: Invalid categories mixed with valid ones
   - ProposedFoldingMethod: "Method1", "Method2" mixed with "FoldX", "BoxMethod"
   - PackagingQuality: "Good", "Bad" mixed with "Uncertain", "Unknown"
   
3. **Missing Value Patterns**: Strategic missingness requiring business logic
   - Supplier performance data missing for new suppliers
   - Historical incidents missing for new products

#### EDA Key Insights:
- **Class Imbalance**: ~80% "Good" vs 20% "Bad" packaging quality
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Higher failure rates during winter months (heavy garments)
- **Material Impact**: Wool products show 2x higher failure rate than cotton/polyester
- **Supplier Variability**: 10x difference in performance between best and worst suppliers

---

## Week 2 Achievements

### 1. Data Cleaning & Standardization Pipeline

#### Supplier Name Normalization Strategy:
```python
# Implemented robust cleaning logic
'Supplier' + rightmost_letter.upper()
# Result: All variants ‚Üí SupplierA, SupplierB, SupplierC, SupplierD, SupplierF
```

**Business Rationale**: Ensures consistent supplier identification across all datasets, enabling accurate performance tracking and supplier-level aggregations.

#### Categorical Data Cleaning:
- **ProposedFoldingMethod**: Extracted valid methods (Method1, Method2, Method3), removed 15% invalid entries
- **ProposedLayout**: Standardized to LayoutA-E format, removed 12% invalid entries  
- **PackagingQuality**: Binary encoding (1=Good, 0=Bad), removed 8% uncertain entries

**Impact**: Reduced dataset size by 18% but increased data quality by 95%+

#### Numeric Data Standardization:
- **Currency fields**: Removed ‚Ç¨, ¬£, $ symbols and converted to float
- **Percentage fields**: Standardized to decimal format (0-100 scale)
- **Date fields**: Unified datetime format across all datasets

### 2. Data Integration Architecture

#### Integration Strategy Following Academic Best Practices:

**Phase 1: Core Integration**
```
DensityReports (500k) + ProductAttributes (10k) 
‚Üí ProductReference key ‚Üí 485k merged records (97% match rate)
```

**Phase 2: Supplier Performance Integration**
```
Aggregated SupplierScorecard by SupplierName 
‚Üí 18-month averages ‚Üí 100% match rate
```

**Phase 3: Historical Context Integration**
```
HistoricalIncidents aggregated by:
- SupplierName (supplier-level risk)
- ProductReference (product-level risk)  
- SupplierName √ó ProductReference (combination risk)
```

#### Validation Framework:
- **Referential Integrity**: 99.7% successful joins across all datasets
- **Business Logic Checks**: Supplier performance metrics align with incident patterns
- **Temporal Consistency**: Date ranges properly aligned across datasets

### 3. Feature Engineering Framework

#### Temporal Features (Critical for Fashion Retail):
- **Seasonal indicators**: IsWinter, IsSummer, IsSpring, IsAutumn
- **Peak season flags**: Fashion retail calendar alignment
- **Recency metrics**: Days since last supplier/product incident

#### Risk Scoring System:
- **Product Risk Score**: Weight + Material sensitivity + Historical incidents
- **Supplier Risk Score**: Performance metrics + Reliability indicators + Incident history
- **Combination Risk**: Supplier-Product specific risk patterns

#### Interaction Features (Based on Domain Expertise):
- **Wool √ó Winter**: High-risk combination requiring special handling
- **Heavy √ó Winter**: Weight-season interaction for packaging complexity
- **HighRisk Supplier √ó Winter**: Compound risk during peak season

**Business Justification**: Fashion retail shows strong seasonal patterns, and supplier-product combinations have unique risk profiles not captured by individual features alone.

  - max_depth: [4, 6, 8]
  - n_estimators: [100, 200, 300]
  - scale_pos_weight: [1, 2, 3] (class imbalance handling)
- **Expected Performance**: ~86% accuracy, ~0.89 AUC (reference benchmark)

### Evaluation Framework

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness

- **Recall**: Minimize false negatives (catch all "Bad" packages)
- **F1-Score**: Balanced precision-recall performance
- **AUC-ROC**: Ranking quality across all thresholds

#### Business-Focused Evaluation:
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Weighting false negatives heavily (missed "Bad" packages costly)

- **Scalability Assessment**: Performance on large datasets, inference speed

### Feature Importance Analysis

#### Expected Top Predictors (Based on Academic Research):
1. **AvgBadPackagingRate** (Supplier reliability metric)
2. **Weight** (Product complexity indicator)  
3. **Material_Wool_Flag** (Material sensitivity)
4. **IncidentCount** (Historical failure patterns)
5. **IsWinter** (Seasonal pressure indicator)

**Validation Strategy**: Compare our feature importance with published research to ensure model learning meaningful patterns.
